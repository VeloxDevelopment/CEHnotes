Module 6: Trojans and Backdoors

we just finished system hacking
1 piece is collecting user names and passwords
can't just have 1 methodology for this

System Hacking process
-Gain Access
 - low level account access - focus
 - account & password cracking
   - Keylogger = password capture
 - escalation to Admin / Root (or trojan)
-Maintain access - duration of attack
 - executing applications
 - hiding files
-Covering tracks - limit admin reaction
 - clearing logs
 
lets get an account and password by giving the user a trojan
Module Objectives - 
-Defining Trojans and backdoors
-Understanding the various backdoor genre
-Overview of various trojan tools
-Learning effective prevention methods and countermeasures
-Overview of Anti-Trojan software
-Learning to generate a Trojan program

very unlikely in the scope you'll be able to do a real trojan , but needs to be KNOWN

Terms
-Trojan
 - Unauthorized program contained within a legitimate program - hi heres this cool game , play this game , install it and something else ^^
 - performs functions unknown by the user - this is the something else ^^
  - anything evil and unwanted
-Cover Channel - communication channel
 - Hidden transmission
 - Security policy says use this tool for these purposes - we'll use this for X
 - ? what about other uses? -NO
 
Terms
-Bot, Zombie, victim - successful trojan
 - under the control of an attacker
-Backdoor
 - a way in to a compromised system, typically installed by a trojaned piece of software - another avenue to get into the system 
 - sometimes synonym of trojan 
 EC council blends these terms
 
Requirements for trojan
-Privilege to install
 - If you can't install, you can't get it - end user has to have action and install - white lists
-Trusted channel to download - no inspection 
 - If you can't communicate you can't transmit
-Cover channel is better - something that is not inspected by security mechanisms
 - if they don't know you are communicating
 - you can transmit
usually in an email and the code is clicked or the game is selected and downloaded by end user 
doesn't have to be a sychronis communication channel , it can be an asynchronis communication channel
where you use a usb drive with an auto exe , plug it in , auto run , installs trojan

Working of Trojans
-User is presented with opportunity
 -  To install software / Click Here
 - Extra software is installed on victim - i get to play this game! i can't wait! free game this is awesome!
 - Software phones home (recurring) - it goes out and checks in , at first it may install file , then connects up and starts a backdoor , hi im here is there anything you want me to do?
 - Attacker gets access victim - running commands 
 - attacker contorls vicitim and collect data
 
how do we transmit? is there a port that the machine is not using? use reasonable port - admins firewall say its reasonable
admins will say turn off access to ports 137-139 and then you open them back up for trojan
137 is open and thats ok , if its port 666 thats probably an evil port 
data flows back up and seems reasonable

Vectors of transmission
-Any port that is not in use
-Better ports are on that seem reasonable - whatever reason
 - TO IDS
 - To User
 - To administrator
 
Modes of transmission
- ICQ
- IRC
- Attatchments
- Browser or Email - focus
- NetBIOS (File Sharing)
- Fake Programs
- Physical Access - USD thumb drive - work really really well! not disabled on most machines 
- Un-trusted sites and freeware software - anything that is free has something with it 

How do you know if you've been trojaned? YOU DON'T
no clue as to what is going on , the power of machines and the slimness of the trojan 
trojans don't chew up access or network because of small file sizes
super duper quad machines , you'd never notice the small thing
you wouldn't know which process on task manager which takes 5-10mb

How do we convince user?
- Legitimate software compromised - new copy of office or visio , lets say cool new app EverNote , compromise it and download it "here" , fake evernote site , Evernote 2
     - New trial , Cool tool , Version Next , free for you
- Freeware / Winkware
- Fake Programs
- Games
- Attatchments
- USB / CD / DVD

What are you going to use?
this sits in the compromised software 
Netcat (do this) not the rest
-Any port
-Outbound or Inbound connections - reverse 
-TCP or UDP
-port-scanning capabilities - see whats open
-loose source-routing capability - it can redirect and route around failure
-when using look out for reflection - older versions LOOK OUT , when you have control , look for the ECHO if you type DIR you get DDIIRR because 1 is for sending and 1 is for receiving 
   - 2 machines trying to SYN and gets messed up 
-Cryptcat - Encrypted version - another way to cross channel and protect yourself from defenders

best tool outside of ceh
Maltego , NMAP , Netcat , Wireshark = USE THESE 
these tools are built into the latest distribution of BACKTRACK

Know your Trojan ports - classic trojans use specific ports
-http://www.jlathamsite.com/dslr/suspectports.htm
-Basically all of them
-If users are not using them, let's Go!
-What would we use? what ports are reasonable? IDK this requires Scanning

We need to know what kind of trojans are out there and what tools the adversaries are using
we realise a machine has been compromised
we see this thing = report

Types of Trojans -
-Backdoor = designed to give malicious users remote control over an infected computer - a way in
-Exploit
-Rootkit
-ArcBomb = Archives designed to freeze or slow performance or to flood the disk with a large amount of "empty" data when an attempt is made to unpack the archived data
     - kind of DoS - slow machine down
	 - when we decrypt , unzip , untar this takes up processing time
-Banker = Steal user account data relating to online banking systems, e-payment systems and plastic card systems
-Clicker = designed to access internet resources - clickforensics company , monitor clickthroughs and banner-ads , see if innapropriate
     - defenders = we wanna run up the bill on someone who is advertising , so we access a whole bunch of computers click through the banner
	 - we'd see them clicking? today what happens is they submit the queries and intercept BING / GOOGLE and append other search terms that will to banner display
	 - you may have typed "baby doll" on side bar is "teddy bears"
	 - we're doing this on a massive scale - normal browsing with weird search terms 
	 - makes more money for the adversarie given the clicks
-DDoS = Distributed group of computers for reducing availability of service
-Downloader = download and install new versions of malicious programs which will run automatically when the operating system restarts - intervals
-Dropper = Program for installing malware - create EXE for end user 
    - Malware = evil software
	- Wrapper = binds malware & benign software
	- Benign software = what the user thinks they are getting
-FakeAV = Programs that simulate the activity of antivirus software. Designed to extort money from users in return for the purported detection and removal of threats
   - Buy this thing and it will protect you because you are compromised OMG OK
   - happens all the time!
   - this will help me? thank you fake microsoft site!
   - detect and remove threat that may not even exist
   - give them what they didn't want to begin with
-GameThief = this type of malicious program is designed tos teal user account information for online games, YOU STOLE MY GOLD
   - if you went to police and said "someone stole your gold!" ok lets go to your house and get fingerprints
   - NO, did that gold or those points cost you real money? no activity police can track
   - EVERYWHERE
-IM = programs are designed to steal user account data (logins and passwords) for instant messaging programs
   - we could subvert someone and make them use account for something else
   - LIKE TormentedXly engineer someone into delivering information you need when you are not the original person that has been compromised
-Notifier
-Proxy
-Ransom = modifies data on the victim computer by typically encrypting so that the victim can no longer uset he data. Once the data has been taken hostage the user will receive a ransom demand.
   - connect to a machine , encrypt , if you don't pay us we won't send you the key , but the key will never be sent
   - only helpful thing is a good backup of files
-SMS = send text messages from infected mobile devices to premium rate numbers
   - collect money , diposit into another account , paper trail , someone creating money by using your rates
-Spy = spy on user's actions
  - listens and captures key strokes 
-Mailfinder = Harvest emaila ddresses from a computer
  - if i can get onto your computer or email and you have contacts i will take them
  - Hi click this link because its really cool and i miss you and i haven't seen you in a long time but its been sent to 10k people
-PSW

Summary
-Trojans
  - Malicious - remote administration tool
  - To gain and retain access on the target system
-Awareness and preventive measures are the best defense
