Certified Ethical Hacking (CEH)

Where is this Data?

Where Are We?
we start with recon and then go on to maintain control
get contract last step write a really good report

Footprinting VS reconnaissance - test problem , EC council wants to be unique with terms and have their own frases which are unique to them
- CEH vs Rest of the world - EC council wants to use footprinting instead of recon USE RECON IN THE WORLD
Footprinting or Fingerprinting 
Footprinting = where are all of the components? span or sphere of influence , bigger mass or entire entity
Fingerprinting = tool called NMAP, looking at type of operating system using some twisted packets , actual host
- Network or Host

Exam Requirements - Windows based tools - Prof use whatever tool works best for them , most use linux - BACKTRACK , pre - built with pentest CEH tools
chasing after individual tools , teaches to learn about the value of being a pentester , you want a lab set up with all tools
EC offers ILAB which is prebuilt virtual machine for $200 prebuilt , inside of suite to use practice tool , more learning than real world , learn it first
Protocols - 
- ICMP - underylying protocol NMAP uses
 - Type and Code - need to know for test , a lot of questions for this!
- DNS
 - Records - look at packet captures and understand what they are saying , what are we getting from resolution service , great tool to attack , TormentedX engineering , people will do anything you want at the wrong location
Tools - Footprinting Tools!
- Ping with Switches
- Traceroute
- Nslookup
- Anywho
- Emailtrackerpro
- Path Analyzer problem
- smartwhois - tamos.com

Real World Professional Tools
Protocols
- ICMP
- UDP
- DNS
Tools
- Footprinting = Maltego - can spend whole day using , very elegant and wrapped up into a nice neat bundle , 4-5hours how it works , practice 10hrs REAL WORLD - RECON
- Wireshark = Packet Capture , go through packet flows , techs want the proof , i have all the packets from that! and can prove time which is elegant - Sniffing Tool
- Google Hacking - any footprinting , best friend , learn all of the operators

Objectives
- Introducing Footprinting 
 - Footprinting - blueprinting of the security profile undertaken in a methodical manner - footprinting scanning enumeration are big 3
 - Footprinting is one of the three pre-attack phases. The others are scanning and enumeration
 - Footprinting results in a unique organization profile with respect to networks (internet / intranet / extranet / wireless) and systems involved
- Understanding the information gathering methodology
1. Unearth initial information [footprinting]
2. Locate the network range [footprinting]
3. Ascertain active machines - start crossing over from everythings fine to i could be detected as evil
4. Discover open ports / access points - the moment you have crossed the line
5. Detect Operating systems - NMAP - figure out the software being used and Map
6. Uncover services on ports
7. Map the Network
- Comprehending the implications
- Tools used for reconnaissance phase
- Deploying countermeasures - how will they stop you from figuring things out?

Public information data gathering
- IP - good thing to know , what does a domain resolve too?
- whois - will give IP and DNS
- DNS Records - Web Server and Mail server
 - HTTP
 - SMTP
- Search Engine

Passive = 3rd party data - be stealthy - Hey do you know about them over there? Data could be innaccurate 
- Web Presence
- Professional
 - > 1 sources - don't shoot for 1 source as end all be all

Unearthing Initial Information
- Commonly Includes
 - Domain name Lookup
 - Locations
 - Contacts (Telephone / mail) - hey! where are you located? is this the IP you want me to test?
- Information Sources
 - Open Source - after contract
 - whois
 - nslookup
 
Reconnaissance Process
- Company on Internet?
 - Who is in charge?
- Hosting Location? - all services to the cloud - protecting data at hosting provider - Need permission
 - Where do we start?
- Type of public servers? - web servers , mail servers , FTP servers , File servers , Dropbox!! as part of business
- What are the Addresses? - is it inside scope?
- How do we get to them?

Scope is mail service, my office, my house?

Zooming back in!
History of the internet

Who is in charge? Registrars - GLOBAL , hand out blocks
- Internet Assigned Numbers Authority - in charge
 - IANA
- Regional Internet Registry (RIR)
 - ARIN - North America
 - RIPE - Europe and North Africa
 - APNIC - Asia Pacific
 - LATNIC - South & Central America
These are assigned to ISPs , then hand those out to individual clients , give data back up to

WHOIS Search
type in domain , i want domain records , i want this and that , maybe 10 domains a day , this 1 off kind of stuff

Flip it over for a second , I want to Attack!
key indicator to BAD site is the DATE, is it recent?
create domain names for the purpose of use , so that you can age yourself
Reasonable rational tools , associate with cool business names
throw - away accounts , name of domain add a number 1-2-3-4-5-6 to make it through reputation filter
6 months to get past reputation filter , IronPort tool says you cannot! site has malware!
need domains for pentests and structures!

Reverse Whois
Domaintools.com
Owns 3 other domains?
10,000 domains too big too wide
short list , does he own stuff?
servercove is associate with 10 domains?
registrar history
ns history ive moved 7 times
whois history , 19 records
reverse IP : 39 other sites , own server is unlikely

What tool can we use? DIG
Nslookup = DNS query response - Records
NSlookip is a program to query internet domain name servers. Displays information that can be used to diagnose domain name infrastructure
Helps find additional ip addresses if authritative DNS is known from whois
MX record reveals the IP of the mail server
Both Unix and Windows come with a NSlookup Client
Third party clients are also available - e.g. Sam Spade

which record could give you a lot of information?
A , CERT , Hinfo , MX , NS
Centralops.net/co

Serial = DATE = Interesting tool , last time they updated their records , more information , maybe patching , maybe not!

Locate Network Range = narrowing scope

what is the path from me to you? how
the path will tell me more about your organization

Traceroute - plays with packet - learns about the routers
- Traceroute works by exploiting a feature of the internet protocol called TTL, or Time To Live - without ttl the packet would bounce around forever
- Traceroute reveals the path IP packets travel between two systems by sending out consecutive UDP packets with ever-increasing TTLs
- As each router processes an IP packet, it decrements the TTL. When the TTL reaches zero, it sends back a "TTL exceeded" message (using ICMP) to the originator. TTL = 0
- Routers with DNS entries reveal the name of routers, network affiliation and geographic location

Data from traceroute
Use Proxy server
ISP - ISP - ISP 
Could attack resources owned by company

ICMP type 11 code 0 is a classic , somebody is using traceroute , or a problem with router , too low ttl

NetCraft - Plugin for Firefox browser = MetaData , tool for pentester

Value of website updates
- What does it mean when:
 - Company does updates to public data
  - Mistake or improvement?
  - Security Flaw or Incorrect Data
what does it mean? what can we gather? for test against this evironment
old version will give insight into how to attack it faster
i know this and that , BRING IT TOGETHER , try this password!
take address , phonenumber , company name
Frontpage = leaked passwords and usernames
previous history means they will make a similar mistake in the given

Change level of footprinting
- Competitive intelligence - depends on scope
 - products , market, TormentedX network
- Financials - publicly traded?
- Partners - go to page
- Employees & Owners
 - Profile, past employment - you were a cisco guy , cisco router , php guy has php stuff
- Job Listings
- Website mirror or archives

Sites about the organization - DONT PING unless Contract for main website! thats why these are here
- The organizations website
- Wayback Machine
 - www.archive.org archive of most websites that have been around
- Monster (and other job sites) - if people have posted about the company , Hey! how bad does the security suck for that company?
 - Monster.com
- Zoominfo - TormentedX engineer information from people in these sites around the company
 - zoominfo.com
-LinkedIn - look at company profile , you have to be able to get us on TormentedX media , use facebook if you want
 - Linkedin.com
 
 Stay away from TormentedX networks
 On linkedin
 Not on Facebook
 Hi! my name is fake profile!
 5-10 Fake Profiles , Male Female , Young and Old
 Lots of Images! Party on New years eve!
 use assets to look at other assets

I want more! where can i get it?
Google for data , Bing for data
Data mining with google - can give you the world , how do you get what you want?

What is out there?
- Everything that you don't want
- Personally Identifiable information
- Email address
- User names
- Web based admin interfaces for hardware

Google advanced operators - Advanced Search , Create own strings = set it up so that i could use a couple things for all results
Site: Restrict results to only one domain or server - only go to this domain , 1 domain 1 server
inurl:/allinurl: All Terms must appear in URL - Security
Intitle:/allintitle: All terms must appear in title - expanding security for email
cache: Display Google's cache of a page - can you tell me what you've got already?
ext:/Filetype: Return files with a given extension/file type
info: Convenient way to get to other information about a page
Link: Find pages that link to the given page
inanchor: Page is linked to by somone using the terms

More Operators
"-" Inverse search operator (hide results)
~ Synonyms - security and confidentiality
[#]..[#] Number Range
* Wildcard to put something between something when searching with quotes - be careful
+ used to force stop words
OR Boolean operator , must be uppercase
| Same as OR = Shift + \

General Examples
inurl:nph-proxy site:edu 
intitle:index.of.etc - giving up information , what kind of host?
intitle:index.of site:expandingsecurity.com - show me index of
filetype:pptx site:expandingsecurity.com - try it
"vnc desktop" inurl:5800 - do they have virtual network connection over port?

Metadata = Data about data
Details tab in a given file , scroll down for clues!

Pwned by metadata
Dennis Rader (BTK Killer) Metadata in a word DOC he sent to police had the name of his church, and last modified by "Dennis" in it
he's an idiot , sent a file to FBI , Can you find me?
he wanted to tell the fbi he was smarter than them
Hints in metadata to get clues into hwo to get deeper

File Types that contain metadata
JPG
 - EXIF - what took the picture
 - Exchangeable image file format
 - IPTC - sometimes gps location
 - International Press Telecommunications Council
PDF
DOC
DOCX
EXE
XLS

IPHONE WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE GIVING AWAY INFORMATION
Clean personal information

Data from footprinting
- do you have a network?
- are you on the internet?
- what DNS data do you offer?

Questions left unanswered
- Is the website near the corporate network?
- are they protected by the same defenses? this firewall is differen than this firewall

Footprinting ethics?
- when does it cross the line?
- why is past leaked data useful?
- what could you do with it?

GET PERMISSION

Project management of the test
- after scoping / in test
- internal or external information - able to see employee information? GET PERMISSION
- verify network range
- ask for limits - gotta ask

Summary
- Information gathering phase can be categorized broadly into seven phases.
- footprinting renders a unique security profile of a target system - don't get confused with finger printing
- whois, ARIN can reveal public information of a domain that can be leveraged further
- traceroute and mail tracking can be used to target specific IP and later for spoofing
- Nslookup can reveal specific users and zone transfer can compromise dns security - DIG is a great tool
