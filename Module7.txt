Module 7: Viruses and Worms

you should think we should not play with these
gotta look at this as if we're a pen tester and they are already compromised with a virus

Module Objectives
-Chernobyl
-Explore Zip
-I love you
-Melissa
-Pretty Park
-Code Red Worm
-Klez
-BugBear
                            -Malware parts
							-Malware Types
							-Time Line
							-Malware of note
							-Current malware
							-Anti-Virus software
KNOW THESE Types
in the CEH class they teach malware and dean is against it
great AV
anytime you're creating a virus you're creating harm
nowhere besides lab , do this 

Malware components
-Insertion - getting on computer - end user interaction
-Avoidance - Hide - protect itself
-Eradication - cover tracks - how to we remove it
-Propagation - replication - how - today they don't go over 1 channel , may email , may open ports 
-Trigger - causes initiation of payload - click & install
-Payload - what is delivered - usually the self-replicating or collecting data
Where did the malware come from?

Types of Malware
-Virus - user initiated
-Worm - service / server vulnerability - not user - vulnerability in server or service 
-Trojan - Overt & Covert actions - heres cool game , heres software underneath
-Logic Bomb - time or condition to start - TRUE - April Fools Jokes
-Blended Threat - multi-vector attack - wrap these things together - these are targeting audience or software , custom adversarie

when were you born? 1996
Timeline of Malware 1966-92
-1966 - first thought
  -John von Neumann "Theory of self-reproducing automata"
-1971 - Proof of concept
 - Creeper by Bob Thomas - first virus
-1983 - Language
  -'Virus' is coined by Frederick Cohen
-1986 - platform dependant
  - Brain - first IBM PC compatible virus
-1989 - multi-vector attack
  - Ghostball - first multipartite virus - different kinds of virus not multi-vector
-1992 - hysteria
  - Michelangelo - was expected to create a digital apocalypse - DIDNT
-1995 - Macro virus
  - Concept
-1996 - polymorphic virus hey this is me :)
  - Ply
-1999 - email as a delivery vector

  THIS MALWARE WILL COME BACK
  "oh this macro is good , lets create a whole new database of scripts for it"
  MAKE MORE AND MORE AVAILABILITY
  NEXT COOL TOOL SOMEONE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT WITH MALWARE
Motivation for creation
-Hacking - to see if its possible
-Fame - not here 
-Fortune - dollars are today's motivation
-Cause - oh crap - will not rest until they get what they want - tougher , they will not stop

why learn the history?
because this teaches us creativity as a pentester
something new is coming out and we say ok well how would an attacker abuse that
your job is to do the normal things and then with creativity to make up something new to show what the attackers will do
so the organization can be more vigilant
DO SOMETHING NEW FOR PROTECTION
learn from history for creativity
Historical Malware
-Why do we care?
-Those that forget history are doomed to repeat it, over and over and over...

since this there has been many more created for RPCD on windows
now what you see is many exploits which go after RPCDcom

Details of a new virus
-YoyoDDos: A new family of DDos bots by Jeff Edwards
10-15 pages of detail about this virus
read this to understand the complexity of what is happening today with viruses

Write your own simple virus
1. Create a batch file Game.bat with the following text
 1. @echo off
 2. delete c:\winnt\system32\*.*
 3. delete c:\winnt\*.*
2. Convert the Game.bat btch file to Game.com using bat2com utility
3. Assign Icont o Game.com using Windows file properties screen
4. Send the Game.com file as an e-mail attachment to a victim
5. When the victim runs this program, it deletes core files in WINNT directory making windows unusable
 THIS WILL NOT WORK - but the structure will if you use the right path ;) - this will blow up a machine 
think like this: People like games, what payload? evil - delete stuff, how do we turn it into a file for them , make it .com , cool icon which people like
make your own icon, whats your delivery? they will click it

What will work?
-Have your anonymous house in order
  -Freemail account not linked to you
  -An IP address at a internet cafe
  -A throw-away machine
     ALL OF THESE HAVE TO BE SET
-You are going to find it
 -Look up Rosenthal Virus Simulator - lots of evil things 
 -The first place on the list - evil - you can see what they are doing in virus
   - A place to play
go in a throw-away environment and see what is going on
write em but don't release them 
prepare for the eventualiaty
if you just read yoyodos its ok but if you want next level go Rosenthal Virus Sim
if you are not anonymous , these people will track you down and may cause problems
if you go to the wrong place , interactions are monitored , 3-letter agency will come to your door FBI

whats the best Anti-Virus?

Summary
-Today's malware is about control
-E-mail is a delivery system for malware
-Virus codes can be simple - detected
-Periodically scan for infections
