Module 16: Evading IDS Firewalls and Honeypots
as a certified ethical hacker will try to sneak into networks
some cases undetected
ids firewalls and honeypots will stop you
what are they?
then you can work around them
find out how the tool and the signature works
in all that you do , collect and secure
don't publish or show people
if you need a password do not ask the person directly, look on social media and find their favorite color ect. and create a brute force password file

Module Objectives
-Intrusion Detection System - monitor and report, and procedures to take
 - Intrusion Prevention System = filter for what is allowed and what is not allowed 
-System Integrity Verifiers
 - System Integrity Verifiers (SIV) monitor system files to find when an intruder changes
 - Tripwire - tool - host based integrity of files tool, look for changes in "these" files report it too me
 - Agent - database - hashing 
    - you need to find out when a company is reviewing this information, is it daily? weekly? within these timeframes is when you attack
-Anomaly Detection
-Signature Recognition
-How does an IDS match signatures with incoming Traffic?
-Honey Pots

Intrusion Detection
-Anomaly Detection - white
  - abynormal = bad = match this pattern you are definetly bad
   - we have 20% php
   - we have 35% smtp
   - we have 20% html
   - we have 25% java
    - durastic changes in these gain attention
 - Activity defined as normal
 - Network throughput
-Signature Recognition
 - Pattern match
 
Snort = Tool
-Intrusion Detection System
-Open Source
-http://www.snort.org/
-Get it
-Load it
-Learn it
Razorback = VM

Basic concept: Signature = image = signature
evil = black list
good = white list

IDS - processing
-Data collection - tap
 -Network-Based
 -Host-Based
 -Application-Based
-Data correlation - console
-Data summarization - program
-Data interpretation - human

IDS - views
-Network-Based (NIDS) - Packet - impersonation is best for attacking
 - No identity
 - valid traffic?
-Host-Based (HIDS) - Person - use hijack or spoof
 - Authenticated
 - Valid application?
-Application-Based - Process - act af its normal packets, we want to pass this data into the sql database
 - Authorized
 - Valid fork?

IDS - Tuning / programming
-Signature files
-Collected
 -Before install
-Learned - they turn these devices or programs on with the "learning mode" do INAPPROPRIATE traffic at this time, its ok if DEAN does this
-False positive review
pattern of activity that you can present to the IDS and it make it through, like http rules ; sport rules ; or porn rules or 
can't be bothered with this in the intrusion detection system 
WIRESHARK! - validate rules to be aware 

Evading IDS Systems
-Pattern matching
 - Database of attacks
 - Is your IDS database complete?
 - Could it ever be?
-Evasion focuses on altering a pattern
-What if abnormal traffic was identified as reasonable to block?
re-create the IDS of your target system and then test it yourself by using your techniques and understanding the Flags that come in
throw in extra junk, that looks like attacks from someone else, evade signature or distract operator

NMAP -D
-Take a few IPS fromt he DShield list blacklist
 - Use them as input to Nmap's "decoy scan" feature.
 - Makes it look to the defender like those other addresses are scanning them as well.
-What happens?
 - In a high percentage of cases is that once an analyst does a few lookups and sees that the source IPs are on a major blacklist, they write off any additional port scans that may be going on at that moment as noise.
 
Most detection is time/buffer based
-Assumption-Defender has all signatures 
  - Pretty big assumption
-How long are clients holding
 - incomplete session open?
-How long is ISD keeping track of all
 - incomplete sessions?
-How many sessions can IDS keep track of?
 - E(Incomplete sessions) < E(IDS tracking)
-How long is attacker willing to wait?

Other ways to pretend?
-Evasion - distraction
-Distraction
 - Impersonation/Spoofing
-Timing between IDS & client
 - Fragmentation

Hacking through firewalls
-Pass legitimate protocol
 - with buffer overflow to the service
-Firewalls
 - No deep packet inspection
 - They can-but should they?
  - Shun = block you for an interval look for these, best way to deal with this is to have 2 IPs , 1 is good 1 is bad , measure the timing of the bad to fine tune it
  
Backdoors through Firewalls
-Reverse www shell
-If firewall allows users to use port 80 or 443
  - To unrestricted web sites
  - then attackers can turn this around
  - to use as command and control
-Legitimate-looking answer from server
  - operated by the attacker
with the BYOD = bring your own device atmosphere, you compromise a device while it is not on the company network, than have it phone home use www shell once it is back inside the corporation

Covert Channels
-Tunneling = one protocol over another
 - HTTP rides over TCP
 - TCP rides over IP
-Could we
 - Change the flags in TCP
 -Use the flags for a different reason
  - When i set SYN 3 times in a row, Do X - Port knocking 
-Was this an intended use?
-Are we looking for this?

Covert Channel examples
-Httptunnel
-Loki
-ACK Tunneling
-AckCmd
