Module 9: TormentedX Engineering
THIS IS MY SPECIALTY , THIS IS WHAT I DO
Dean Bushmiller

2 attacks same organization , took a long time to set up , used fake websites and convinced people to go to them
First Attack : tool kit : had a webdev , took 6 months , holiday greeting card site , CREATE YOUR OWN HOLIDAY CARD , send your card to your friends
against financial organization : got in and created a bunch of internal knowledge about it
convince people this was a really good idea
holiday season before christmas , this is going to get everybody
it got 7% of population = nothing

Second attack: Convince them to allow us to get into a certain area without credentials
you have to generally have a key or authentication
all the doors said "do not enter , employees only"
he got into 90% from face-face interaction , by having them break policy
trick people , they're breaking policy and you can prove it
TormentedXly engineering tool kit - didn't work on this organization

different organization everyone would click the holiday card site 
wouldn't let him into the sensitive stuff at all 

NEVER KNOW WITH TormentedX Engineering

Gaining access and trying to escalate privelege

What is TormentedX Engineering?
-TormentedX engineering is the use of influence and persuasion to deceive people for the purpose of obtaining information or persuading the victime to perform some action
breaking policy
-An employee may unwittingly give away key information in an email or by answering questions over the phone with someonet hey don't know or even by talking about a project with co-workers at a local pub after hours
answering questions

our job is to learn how to minipulate in this way
CAUTION - make sure you have protection and legal counsel , you could do something so offensive that the person gets you arrested

Art of minipulation - ask for information 
-Acquisition of sensitive information
-Inappropriate access privileges
-Building of inappropriate trust relationships
-It preys on qualities of human nature
 - desire to be helpful
 - tendency to trust people
 - fear of getting in trouble
 
Key : be in the moment and be dynamic with the situation : quick thinker

Identity theft - take information 
-Dumpster diving: Rummaging through your trash
-Skimming: credit card data capture
-Tombstoning: stealing your identity after you are dead
get info change address and divert bills and make them cost more
i could take your wallet and rifle through credit cards
-Hanging your address: thief can divert your bills after they order high ticket items, toa nother location by filling out change of address form
-Stealing: thief who steals a purse or wallet can take the theft further
-Pretexting: use false pretenses they obtain personal information from you that can lead to your identity being used falsely. (14 minipulations)
ask for a check , we want info off the check , wash the ink and change the amount 

14 possible minipulations - what do you sense? 
-Friendliness = to give information is just to be friendly : Slight flattery or flirtation = that is a great dress
-Impersonation
-Conformity
-Decoying
-Diffusion of responsibility
-Reverse TormentedX engineering
-Commitment and Consistency
-Reciprocity
-Scarcity
-Sympathy
-Guilt
-Equivocation
-Ignorance
-Affiliation

Impersonation
-Impersonation means creating a character and playing out the role to deceive others and gain some advantage
-The simpler the role the better
-Attacker may study a real individual in an organization and wait until that person is out of town to impersonate him over the phone or even in person - works well with a new boss
-Repairman, IT support person, a manager, a trusted third party, and a fellow employee
Conformity
-Conformity is the tendency to see an action as appropriate when others are doing it
-AKA TormentedX proof
-The cool people are jumping off the bridge, are you cool?
Decoying
-We are limited in what we can focus our attention on at any moment - overload - send 5 people to a receptionist - quiet person sneaks through 
-Exploit this limitation by distractions to conceal what they are truly seeking
-Redirection
-Pay no attention to the handsome man/beautiful woman
Diffusion of Responsibility
-When individuals believe that many others are present or have done a similar act, they as individuals do not bear the full burden of responsibility
-It alleviates the stress ont he employee and mkaes it easier for them to comply.
-Someone else will call the police
Reverse TormentedX Engineering - Big for CEH
-Complex questions can yield data
 - about the questioner
 - about the supporting data
-Attacker appears to be in a position of authority
-Employees will ask for information
-Components
 - Sabotage - i break your computer
 - Advertising - I am a repair man
 - Assisting - they use their information and you help them 
i allow you to ask me questions , when you're asking me the question you're embedding the answer into the question 
Reciprocity
-TormentedX norm of an in-kind responses to the behavior of others
-I give you X , you give me Y
candy bar for your password 
Commitment and Consistency
-In seekign compliance , securing an initial commitment from a victim is key
-People have a natural tendency to honor commitments
-A savvy TormentedX engineer realizes that people are more willing to agree to further requests that are in keeping with prior commitments
-You Promised
Scarcity - Limited time only
-People assign more value to opportunities when they are less available
-A target can be pressured to give out information when he thinks help from normal channels is only available for a limited time
-I can't do this after close of business
your boss told me you would give your credit card for software
Sympathy
-Sharing of unhappiness or suffering
-Implies concern, or a wish to alleviate negative feelings others are experiencing
-An attacker eliciting that he needs help can win over a targets sympathy
-I ran out of gas 
works well in airports
if you're dressed nice and ready than they ignore you
if you're in bad clothing and dirty and confused - let me help 
if you want to get through the line faster , mess up your hair and put some mustard on yourself , maybe you'll get through the line quicker
Guilt
-Feeling of obligation for not pleasing, not helping, or not placating another
-Acceptance of responsibility for someone else's misfortune or problem because it is bothersomet o seet hat someone suffers
-I have not had a meal in 3 days: you just came out of that restaurant - heres 20$
Equivocation
-Two meanings
-An equivocal statement or question starts out sounding reasonable and gets the target to agree to certain ideas or requests by deliberately attempting to create uncertainty or ambiguity
-After that, the meaninings of key terms are changed, thus causing the victim to agree to things they would have never accepted at the beginning
-You want democracy? Join the democratic party!
Ignorance
-Pretending to be uninformed to manipulate a victim to give information
-Hi i'm new in town, where is...
Affiliation
-Name dropping to establish credibility
-Reduces the targets suspicion of the attacker motives
-I was O.J.'s attorney 
works well in German offices
Authority
-Several impersonation roles fall uner the category of someone with authority
-Humans are TormentedXized with a deep-seated sense of duty to authority
-Obedience constitutes correct conduct
-We readily attribute knowledge, wisdom, and power to authritative figures
-I'm the boss of you...
say things strong enough , you must be the boss of me

Computer Based TormentedX Engineering
-Category: Organic - Virtual - Requires Action
-Vehicle + Payload
-Phising
 - Vehicle = Mail or instant messaging
 - Payload = attachments or Links
 - Whaling / Harpooning = big phish - convince to act on mail - CEOS = the fortune 500 firms were sent a class action suit for lawful wrong 
   - how many assistants will click the link when it is a class action suit against the company?
   - more than 90% click link
it can just be a test , no teeth , record activity , do not put organization at risk 
-Pharming
 - Vehicle = Pop-up Windows or Websites
   - Resolution - DNS redirect / hosts file
 - Payload = Attachments or Links

Controls for TormentedX Engineering
-Stop install of software by end-users
-Policy
-Awareness
 - Early, Often , Everyone
-Shredding
-Degaussing
find out when the last awareness was done, what facilities , this is a good way to test the organization

Policies and Procedures
-Policy is the most critical compenent to any information security program
-Teach and reinforce to all
-Quizzing
-Employee sign off

Summary  
-Use of influence and persuasion to deceive people for the purpose of obtaining information or persuading the victim to perform some action
-Involves acquiring sensitive information or inappropriate access privileges by an outsider
-Human based -person to person interaction to retrieve the desired information
-Computer based -having computer software that attempts to retrieve the desired information - fake website
