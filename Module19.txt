Module 19: Penetration Testing
this is a business, talking to your customers
dont be a test taker -> click monkey
LEARN THE TOOLS -> Metasploit -> does full circle
Bolt to other tools for Reconn, NMAP+NESSUS

Overview
-How would you find a good map?
-How does Metasploit fit penetration testing?
-What are basic parts?

Disclaimer
-Want to do jail time?
-Want to get fired?
-This set of tools will make the above most possible!
-Don't even download it if-
 - Don't have permission on corporate assets
 - Don't have written permission to run it
 - Don't have contract with authority

Introducing Metasploit
-An advanced open-source exploit research and development framework
-Http://metasploit.com
-Current stable version: 3.6 with 860 exploits
-Written in Ruby
-Runs best on Linux
-Versions
 - Free: Framework
 - Paid: Pro

How do I get it?
-Build up a virutal linux host : Kali<3
-Install from metasploit.com
-Update the files
-Or pull fully loaded images
-BackTrack or OWASP WTE (GET IT)

Doneinmetasploit
export Nmap files as XML

Basic Exploit Steps
-Scan for IP & Port using what? -Nmap or Maltego
-Start Metasploit
 - Choose exploit based on host
 - Select a payload & parameters
 - You are in
-Can it really be that easy?
 - You can make it as complicated as you want

An exploit
-An attack on a vulnerability of sofware
-May or may not generate an event
-Software is not programmed to recover from this event
-Result:
 - Sysetm spots functioning correctly
 - Someone else is in control

When does this become critical?
-If there is a known vulnerability
 - O.S. or application
-Is there a written exploit?
 - Zero day or make it yourself (shell coding)
 - Widely available > 2 downloads
-Is there a patch/update for the vulnerability?
-Then Metasploit might have an exploit

Why would you do this?
-Penetration Testing
-If the bad guys have it and are using it
-We should use it on ourselves first
-Now we know we are weak
-Let us bring it to management's attention
-Let them prioritize
-Let us patch
 
Interfaces - how do we interact
-Msfcli - one shell at a time, learning
-Msfweb - phased out
-Msfconsole - centralized console - hardcore

msfconsole
-Way to access most of the features within Metasploit
 - Alternates: Rapid 7 or Armitage
-Provides a console-based interface to the framework
-Contains the most features and is most stable MSF interface
-Full readline support, tabbing, and command completion
-Execution of external commands in msfconsole is possible
-Runs on Windows as of MSF version 3.3

Exploits categories
-Active exploits
 - Target specific host, run until completion, and then exit.
 - Brute-force modules will exit when a shell opens on victim
 - Module execution stops if an error is encountered
-Passive exploits - Social Engineer Toolkit
 - Wait for incoming hosts and exploit them as they connect
 - Focus on clients such as web browsers, FTP clients, email.

Active Example = images = Activeexample + activeexample2

You need passive - let you go have lunch!
-You are a busy person
-You cannot be waiting around for users
-You really need many consoles running
 - That's why we use msfconsole
-Passive exploits support the waiting around while you...
 - Do the rest of the penetration test

Understanding Payloads in Msf
-We want command control (maintain)
-Accomplished witht he help of a payload
-Payload is a sequence of code that is executed whent he vulnerability is triggered
-EXPLOIT = Vulnerability + Payload
-Written in Assembly Language
-Platform and OS dependent
 - A Win32 payload will not work in Linux
 -(even if we are exploiting the same bug)
-Different payload types do different tasks
 - Exec - Execute a command or program on the remote system
 - download_exec - Download a file from a URL and execute
 - upload_exec - Upload a local file and execute
 - adduser - Add userto system accounts
 - And....
- Most common payload is shellcodes or aka shell payloads
 - Interactive shell that can be used to control the system remotely
 - The term is inherited from Unix /bin/sh
 - for Window command prompt cmd.exe
-Types of shell payloads
 - Bind Shells
  - A socket is created, a port is bound to it and when a connection is established to it, it will spawn a shell.
 - Reverse Shells
  - Instead of creating a listening socket, a connection is created to a predefined IP and Port and a shell is then shoveled to the Attacker

3 Payload module types
-Singles - self-contained and completely standalone
 - adding a user to the target system
-Stagers - setup a network connection between the attacker and victim
 - Designed to be small and reliable
 - Multiple similar stagers happen
 - Metasploit will use the best one when it can
 - Default is now NX + Win7 compatible
-Stages - Payload components that are downloaded by Stagers modules
 - Payload stages automatically use 'middle stagers'
 - A single recv() fails with large payloads
 - The stager receives the middle stager
 - The middle stager then performs a full download
 - Better for RWX

What is Meterpreter?
-Just another payload...
-Advance, dynamically extensible payload
-Uses in-memory DLL injection stagers -Oh $h!+
-Extended over the network at runtime
-Communicates over the stager socket
-Provides a comprehensive client-side Ruby API

What do you get from Meterpreter?
-New features are added by loading extensions
 - I want to run a custom DLL that the victim doesn't have
-From your MSF machine
 - client uploads the DLL over the socket
-ON victim
 - server running ont he victim
 - loads the DLL in-memory
 - Initializes it
 - new extension registers itself with the server
-From your MSF machine (The client on the attacker's machine)
 - loads the local extension API
 - can now call the extensions functions of custom DLL
 Process is seamless and takes approximately 1 second to complete 

What else from Meterpreter?
-Run post/windows/manage/migrate
-getsystem - h = escalation to system
-getuid = whoami

meterpreter can give us all this extra stuff - AMAZING
can't get it ALL done with meterpreter

Auxiliary Modules
-Framework includes hundred of auxiliary modules
-Perform scanning, fuzzing, sniffing, etc.
-Will not give you a shell
-Valuable when conduction a pentration test 

Migration of a process, Why?
-You have gotten in.
-What you have done may look suspicious
-You may make the machine seam sluggish by being int he users process space with the user
-The user may exit the browsers
-You are in, move to a more difficult place to detect- like SVChost = maintain control

We want to be
-Stable across reboots
-Escalate privileges

One last module
-Browser Autopwnc by Egypt
-Performs browser fingerprinting
 - Prior to launching exploits
-If the remote PC is using internet explorer 6, it will not launch IE7 exploits 
Noisy!

We need a Database framework
-Dradis
 - Store your results for quick resource
 - Share your data with your team
 - Assist with writing final report
 - Communicating over SSL
 - Import Nmap and Nessus result

Dradis in Backtrack - Kali<3
-How do you get it?
 - apt-get install dradis
 - cd/pentest/misc/dradis/server
 - ruby ./script/server

You still need a database
-Metasploit supports
 - MYSQL
 - PostgreSQL
-We need to tell Metasploit to use the database driver
 - From msfconsole
 - msf > db_driver mysql

How do i extend Metasploit?
-Learn Ruby
-Learn Shellcoding
-Study operating system flaws
-Write your own exploits 
Reverse Engineering - You win!

Plan Vs Report = image = planvsreport

Planning
-Contract, Contact, Permission
 - Attackers - Go to jail
 - Penetration testers - go to bank
 - Authorization - to operate
 - Contact - think of it like a meeting
  - you need to know whom to call on both sides
-Requires
 - Scope - When, How long, Who, What

Report
-Collect the data as you proceed
 - Packet trace everything
 - Never turn on your attack machines
  - Until the trace is on
-Do it with automation - pull data from nessus, maltego, nmap, metasploit, wireshark - encrypt, 15-20 page report for business meeting
 - Technologists hate writing reports
 - Make it easy
-Roll up to
 - Operations
  - Actionable items
 - Management
  - Abstractions that make sense

Summary
-Learn or watch it
-Use it as part of your penetration testing

Reality Check
-Any methodology must be tailored
-Per project basis
-Per Scope
-Anyone with great system is not telling

Generic or Specific
-Everyone outside knows the generic
 - Relate to what they already know
 - Transition to what they don't know
 - Make it easy on new people
-Specific
 - Repeatability increases speed
