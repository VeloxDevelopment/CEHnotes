Module 4: Enumeration

you know what host you're going after
you know the services they are offering up
we are going to dig deeper

Objective
- Enumeration 
- Null Session
- NetBIOS
- SNMP
- DNS
- Active Directory
- SMTP
- NTP

What is enumeration?
-To list from start to finish - please! - this is what it means , usually Numbered , this is item 1-2 or this is item N
-Typically a database - some databases have 1 entry , some have a lot!
-Requires active connections to systems - you will be found out unless you are very careful and very slow
 - Lightning Raid - We go in we grab that file and that will be it , we won't come back for months at a time , is this ok with customer
-It is a directed query - be specific what we are capturing
-Data gained
 - Network resources and shares
 - Users and groups
 - Applications and banners
  -Show: - this is enumeration!!
   - Users
   - Groups
   - Network resources
   - Shares
   - Applications (you) have!
   
NetBIOS null sessions do not work!
but you have to know about them
some other tools or way will allow you to expose information like a connection stream

Net Bios Null Sessions
-You can establish a Null Session with a Windows host by logging on with a null user name and password
 - Access to a session with no username!
-Information from the host:
   - We are not talking about active directory authentication or curberos here we're talking about local users and group accounts
 - List of users and groups
 - List of mac addresses - network card
 - List of shares - even if you don't have permission of the shares
 - Users and hosts SIDs (Security identifiers) - CROWN JEWELS!

 If you know how it works , how can i apply this in a new way?
 They will ask you on test! Still around on some boxes!
 
How to get a null session
-Open Ports
 - UDP 137 & 138, TCP 139
 - TCP 445
- net use \\host\IPC$ "" /u: - issued command for creating a share 

host could = IP address
IPC = inter process communication 
$ = Hidden share = So this is the share that is listed on ALL machines that are speaking Net Bios and are open on ports
"" = not giving any information
/u: username is! This is show me what anybody could see if they were looking at the IPC$
This is how you establish a Null Session

null sessions are not nearly as useful today and not nearly as prevelent BUT TRY if there is a windows XP or windows 2000 host still out there
 - Because someone left one there TAKE A POKE
 - you might be surprised what is out there
 
Null Session Countermeasure
-Upgrade to XP or 2k3
-Block access to TCP 139 and/ or TCP 445 ports at edge of network
 - Collect data internally and then package it up and send it to yourself
-Disable SMB services SMB = Server message block - depends on environment
-Edit registry to restrict the anonymous user - some boxes require a valid name and password to go with \\host\IPC$ "" /u:

Lets go beyond windows and reach out to a service available on almost all networking tools that are out there

SNMP components
-(1) SNMP- Simple Network Management Protocol
 - Application-layer protocol for managing TCP/IP based networks
 - Port UDP 161 & 162 - authentication could be spoofed if we intercept
 - Current version 3, with Security - the security is not very robust for reasons we'll get too
 - http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3410.txt
-(2) NMS - Network Management Station
 - Device that polls/queries SNMP agent - says Hey router how you doin? Hey switch how you doin? Hey computer how you doin? How you doin x10
 - Can be a computer - USUALLY A COMPUTER - Rolls up this data for tillemetry or operating activities
-(3) SNMP Agent
 - Internetworking device (e.g. Router or Switch) running software that understands SNMP
  - Installed on device that is reporting
  - Theres tons of software that use this that you can enable/disable on machines
-(4) MIB = Management Information Base
  - Structure of all the data in all the databases that conforms across all networking devices - Pretty Amazing
  - You need to know the structure of MIB 
  - Standard to create your own MIBs - Companies who build this stuff would do it, not you
  - You can Look up all of this
 - Database of info conforming to SMI
-(5) SMI Structure of Management Information
 - Standard that defines how to create MIB
 
MIB v2 - Management Information Base
-Object IDentifier (OID) - Serial Number - Very Specific
 - This is subdivision subdivision subdivision
-Example .1.3.6.1.2.1.1 - Standard MIB most people are used too
 -iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1)
   mgmt  (2)
       mib-2(1)
	      system(1)
		  
iso = everything
org = everything
dod = originally created for the military or Department of Defense
You will always see .1.3.6.1 its a LOCK
 - Beyond this 1-2-3-4 is the current branches of the MIB
mgmt (2) = management 
mib-2 (1) = management version 2
system (1) = all the little pieces below = devices, network cards, Router (dig down)
Router - has certain interface , lets say it has a 10mb-100mb-1g-giggy Port - this has a number associated with it
within the port there will be further details 
 - throughput on the network card
 - Error rate of the network card
 - Config info
 - Reporting activity
How fast is SNMP going? How fast is error? Is there any fault with it? is there anything reporting back to me?
config on a query on a regular basis , are things running just fine? we can get really detailed about config info

Now Think!
If you were able to query these devices and find out what kind of network card it was, did it have a lot of errors?
 - you can gather a lot of data that you could then use
Now it goes further
not only is it a query system

SNMP commands
 - From an attacker stand point
  - I want you to change your configuration 
  - I can control the config
  - Use to gain access or something inappropriate
  - Maybe shut down the interface with DoS
-Get
-GetNext
-Set
-Trap

^ These pull data on a regular basis

SNMP Enumeration
-Why is it so easy?
 - Devices don't do complex authentication
  - if they do, it costs CPU cycles
 -SNMP manager is not designed for multi-user security
  - You can brute force password attack - relatively easy , these devices dont defend themselves , you can't have a lock out on your router - theoretically you can
Metadata of this process is good for reporting data
Its job is to Route 
Its gotta be quick and efficient

SNMP Enumeration
-Community string - by default is named Public
  - If you have sniffer you can see it - if it is not Public it will announce itself and say I am something else (stuff, thing, private)
- Password
  - Brute Force - of specific community string
  
what do good guys do to protect themselves against this?
they need SNMP operational

SNMP enumeration countermeasures
-Block 161 & 162 UDP to OR from Internet
-Tune IDS to listen - hey someone is trying to change SNMP 
-Remove the SNMP agent - could disable on device but operational that is bad
-Change the default "public" community name - if someone is listening they can hear it
-On Windows Group
 - Additional restrictions for anonymous connections
-Upgrade to SNMP v3 - best thing because it is more complex or robust 
You gotta be on the local subnet or in control of the firewall or have access
Go after a small asset , capture it and then start shooting SNMP out or listening to SNMP traffic - to avoid countermeasures

FAVORITE THING TO ENUMERATE - GIVES RICH Data = DNS
-Zone transfer - all records
 - (nslookup, is -d <domainname>)
 - Enumerate interesting network information
-You don't need to zone transfer
 - Query will work - individual basis but make it easy for yourself
-External DNS data
 - WWW, SMTP, SOA
 - Reasonable
-Internal DNS data - if windows and someone is really populating there DNS active directory  
 - Authenticator , Domain
 - Bad Idea

Windows DNS Zone transfer
- For clients to locate DNS SRV records - SRV = Server 
- An attacker would look at the following records closely:
 - Global Catalog service (_gc._tcp_)
 - Domain Controllers (_Idap._tcp)
 - Kerberos Authentication {_kerberos._tcp) or (_kerberos._tcp) curly bracket was a mistake?
this gives us a more accurate picture of the target

Blocking DNS Zone transfer
- You can easily block zone transfers using the DNS
- Add DNS security options
 - No internet resolution
get an asset from the outside - some device and have it go in THEN query 

Active Directory Enumeration
- All the existing users and groups could be enumerated witha  simple LDAP query
- The only thing required to perform this enumeration is to create an authenticated session via LDAP
- connect to any AD server using idp.exe port 389
- Authenticate yourself using Guest or any domain account
-Data
 - Users, Computer, any object in AD
With DNS and LDAP you can go at it with two different directions
download AD server and look what can be populated there IT COULD BE EVERYTHING

how do you connect?

How to do AD enumeration
1. Ldp.exe tool
2. Click options , click General, type 9999 in the Page Size box
3. click OK
4. Click Connection, and then click Bind
5. On the Browse menu, click Search.
6. Paste the value of the schemaNamingContext into the Base DN box
7. Paste the following filter into the filter Box:
(&(objectCategory=attributeSchema)
(isMemberOfPartialAttributeSet=TRUE)) 
OR
(&(objectCategory=attributeSchema)(isMemberOfPartialAttributeSet=TRUE)) = give me anything thats got populated data in it 
8. Under Scope click Subtree
9. Click Options 
10. Type attributes that you want = object class and name - coniacle name distinguished name 
11. Click ok
This will give you a list of all the users in the Domain , access server - use port - use account - you get in you WIN 
You can definitely get all of the usernames - from there someone has got to be using Password as their password something simple
 - using only the alphabet with no numbers or upper case and lower case letters
 - guessing these simple password is what narrows down the 28^2 of upper case , lower case , and the infinity of numbers 
Schema is the design of the database , you gotta know a little bit about this 

AD enumeration countermeasures
-The Win 2k dcpromo
 - option 2 during AD installation - which locks down guest access or anon authentication , get another account and you'll be ok 
-Block 389
-Require 3389 on LDAP server - will only flow through certain ports 
All you need is a couple of tools and a low level account 

How about looking at Email?
don't know an account? try something

SMTP enumeration
  - Go on the website of the organization and look up the names within their organization 
  - Find an email address , find the format of the email addresses 
  - Send an email to someone
-Take me to your email
-Fuzzing works well
-Or just look up the contacts
-Matching naming conventions

what do you have?
access to the information on their site
you're giving a user active data which you can use for control

NTP Enumeration
-Time server
-Not much except that you keep good time
what this means is that they need a timing mechanism
if they have NTP = windows AD = large AD organization because they need the NTP server to make sure replication stays correct
just tells you they have some other tools in house that might rely on it 

Summary
- Enumeration involves active connections to systems and directed queries
- The type of information enumerated by intruders includes network resources and states, users and groups and applications and banners
- Null sessions are used often by attackers to connect to target systems.

Good guys block , we go deeper , we have user accounts , time to do password cracking
