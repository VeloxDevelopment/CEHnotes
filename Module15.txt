Introduction to Wireless Networking
-Wireless local area network (WLAN) - focused on here 
-Wireless wide area network (WWAN) - tools like Mifi , cell phone + small wireless network - tethering 
-Wireless networking is everywhere
-Popularity is driven by ease and cost - cheaper than running wires
-Anywhere anytime
-Mobile Devices are everywhere - BYOD - bring your own device
Wireless Warwalk

Wireless Technology Comparison Chart = image ABG
we are sliding away from A and B, but from a test stand point you need to know your speeds and feeds and frequency , and frequency ranges
not many are using anything besides G and N

WLAN structures
-Independent Basic Service Set = "ADHOC networking" = 2 devices talking to each other = Station Wireless Client <------Physical connection SHARED Media------> Station Wireless Client = image ADHOC - No authentication 
-Infrastructure Basic Service Set = Clients don't talk to each other, they talk to an access point which goes to LAN = does not give much control = Image InfraServ 
-Extended Service Set = image ExtendedServ = Access point is under the control of a LAN , control inbetween access point and into

Protocols and Layers = image protocolandlayers
contention free service = increase throughput
MEMO = multiple input multiple output
nice to know not required to know

Setting up WLAN Access
-Access Point
 - Channel 
  - 1-11 = US
  - 1-13 = EU
Service Set IDentifier (SSID)
 - Arbitrary
 - Alphanumeric string
-Wired Configurations
 - IP address
 - Subnet Mask
 - Router

SSIDs
-For wireless networking devices
-A unique identifier
-No protection
-Single shared cleartext password
-Between access point and clients
-Sent out every 100ms if turned on
-Sent out with every client access if turned off
-all you need to do is listen 

What is WEP?
-Component of the IEEE 802.11 WLAN
-Purpose: provide confidentiality
 - as long as we have control over the physical, everything should be OK
 - BUT we do not
-Data Link Layer
-Encryption algorithm - weakened RC4 - so you didn't have to brute force whole key space, only portion, so you can crack it right away

Encryption for Confidentiality
-Life span dependant on
 - Algorithm
 - Implementation of Algorithm
 - Short cuts found after implementation
 - Current brute force capability
WEP is weakened by removing certain part of character structure
good security for future

For example: WEP from 1997
-RC4
-For 24 bit IV 50% chance repeat after 5k packets = IV = initialization vector - listen for repeat 
-Attacker can send 5000 packets - any - there is shortcuts that make this not neccessary 
-2005 - 3min. 2006 - 1min. 2007- 3 seconds

Wireless Security Options
-802.11 WEP - 3 Seconds
 - Dynamic WEP or WEP + (not standard)
-802.11 WPA - 18 minutes
 - Interim Option - for older equipment
 - Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)
 - Per-packet key hashin
 - Broadcast key rotation
 - Sequence counter
 - Key mixing function
-802.11i WPA 2 - Good for now
 - PSK - nope
 - AKA - Robust Security Network (RSN)
 - CCMP = AES in Counter Mode with CBC-MAC
-802.11x - Nope
 - Port based network access control
 - Mac filtering
-TNC / NAC / NAP - Very Setup Dependant
 - this is where you earn your money 

Process overview = Reconn
-Site Map - radio frequency - lines of site - walk with device - Kismet + laptop + alphausb - footprinting
 -RF Map
  -Lines of Sight
  -Signal Coverage
   - standard antenna
   - directional antenna
 -Physical Map
   - Triangulate APs
   - Satellite Imagery
-Network Map
 - MAC filter
  - Authorized MAC Addresses
  - Reaction to Spoofed MAC Addresses - with my alphatranceiver i can impersonate you
 - Encryption Keys Utilized - are they using WPA WPA2
 - Access Point Types - which vendor? what are the wireless client? a lot of cases are "we can't control open air"
  - Extended Service Set Identifier (ESSID)
   - Infrastructure
  - Basic Service set identifier, (BSSID)
   - ad hoc
  - Vendor
   - Channel
   - Associations
   - Rogue AP Activity
 - Wireless Client types
  - MAC Addresses
   - Vendor
   - Operating System Details
   - Adhoc Mode - if they'll take this, we can convince them to pass through rogue access point for visability
   - Associations - if they see the correct set identifier - my laptop is associated with Deans wireless network, ill make mine Deans wireless Network - Pineapple = Tool = mirror associations
  - Intercepted Traffic
   - Encrypted 
   - Clear Text 
-WLAN penetration by encryption

WLAN Penetration General Process
1. Deauth Client - rejects client
2. Associate client - i am the access point
3. Compromise client - give me username and password or no LAN
4. Acquire passphrase / certificate - heres the certificate i need, then hand it off 
5. Obtain user's certificate 

WLAN Penetration by encryption
-Unencrypted WLAN
 - Visible SSID
  - Sniff for IP ranges
   - MAC authorized
   - MAC filtering

Enterprise Solutions
-Trusted Network Connect (TNC)
 - an open architecture for Network Access Control
-Network Access Protection (NAP)
 - Software based - tends toward TNC
 - Feature in Windows Server 2008+

Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC)
-Hardware based - tends away from TNC
-TrustSec includes the following:
 - Cisco Network Admission Control (NAC)
 - Cisco NAC Guest Server
 - Cisco NAC Profiler
 - Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS)
Clean Air = if rogue access points exist and are detected - deauth device and blot it out, push signal away from you and will show device used

TNC/NAC/NAP components
- A technology to analyze the security posture of, and to authenticate, the device
- A policy-related component to configure and set the policy on what specific security criteria will be analyzed on the device
- A technology to communicate the security state of the device to other facets of the NAC/NAP solution
- A mechanism that receives the security posture of the device, and performs an action based upon those results
- A policy-related component to configure and set the policy regarding what action will take place
- A remediation technology whose purpose is to bring the device back to compliance
- A reporting mechanism 

Radius - we can't attack this - we lose here
-Used as additional layer in the security
-Centralized Authentication
 - Behind the access point
-You may get on the access point
-You may not get past it
 - Any authentication is possible 

Wireless card: Atheros chipset
this tool works consistently
this on ebay "Alfa 802.11 wireless card" = 30usd + antenna
Atheros chipset = play nice = promiscuous mode
power to blot out = you use this as an intercept, it sees the alpha card and doesnt allow one of the clients or access point to talk to the others
get in the way and be stronger

Summary 
-Wireless is everywhere
-WEP was a start
-WPA was for a short time
-WPA 2 is safe for now
-VPN & Centralized Authentication = Radius 
-What about tomorrow?
