Module 5: System Hacking

Its a hot day , humid , you've been working and you see a pool infront of you
you do a GIANT cannonball and go AHHHH - system hacking

we will do the stuff!
this is the sexy awesome part
system hacking is about putting the information to good use
collecting information and applying in a way to get away
its the simple stuff at first , pen test puts it all together
we are gaining access!

Module Objective
-Define Process - for test you have to know it - ec council hacking documentation is a little clunky
-Remote password guessing
-Password cracking
-Eavesdropping
-Privilege escalation
-Denial of Service
-Keystroke loggers
-Covering tracks
-Hiding Files
-Buffer overflows

System Hacking Process
1. Gain access
  1. Low level account access - Guest
  2. Account & Password cracking - gather account and password crack
  3. Escalation to Admin / Root - total control - system account
2. Maintain access - duration of attack
  1. Executing applications - gather information then go after another resource - leverage information 
  2. Hiding files - get back to them later on
3. Covering tracks - limit admin reaction - try to make it so they don't see anything
  1. Clearing logs - protect yourself
  
Administrator Password Guessing
-Is NetBIOS TCP 139 port open?
-Connect to an enumerated share (IPC$, or C$) - eventually you'll lock account out , give it a try
-Try user name/password - keep trying 

Automated password guessing
-Use the NT/2000 shell for command based on the standard NET USE syntax - DOES NOT WORK - the share
- 1. Create a username and password files
- 2. Pipe this file into FOR command - heres my list here , heres my little script
- 3. C:\ FOR /F "token=i, 2*" %\ in (credentials.txt) do net use \\target\IPC$%i/u:%j
everytime we attempt the password use this script until we get in

Password Guessing Countermeasures
-Upgrading to 2K3 will not help
-Block ports 135-139
-Complex Passwords
-IDS
 - Log what you can review
 - Log failed logon attempts
 - Event ID
  - 539 -Logon/Logoff - windows
  - 529 -Security log full - different problem
  
what im worried about as a defender , i see a bunch of 529s in a row and i go into user data base and i see a bunch of accounts that are locked out
one account is skipped and not locked out 
what does it mean when this account is skipped?
they found an account with a username and password that works
maybe we unlock all of the accounts or remove logs
what is the effect of what you do
how does it effect the server? clean it out!

Password sniffing
-If you have local segment access
-Email accounts are a good start - SMTP authentication is a great way, you've got an account go on and use that 
  - usually their email password will synchronise with other local area network acocunts 
  - people tend to be lazy and use same password over and over
today still configs , Username and Password is accepted in clear text
if someone is in a coffee shop and uses their email , chances are the password is in clear text somewhere 
are you encrypted? a lot of cases not!

Privelege Escalation - IS WHERE IT IS AT
-Start with a non-admin user account
-Seek privelege of an administrator
-Seek privilege of system = windows - System account , subvert into operating system 

so password cracking
find user account 
user convention
like firstname.lastname
like firstinitiallastname
create list of possible passwords for particular user

Manual Password Cracking Algorithm
1. Find a valid user
2. Create a list of possible passwords
3. Rank the passwords from high probability to low
4. Key in each password
5. Repeat 1-4

if you know what the naming convention is and you have access to the office and its a cube farm , its open, you can see desks
collect the names of all of the people of the particular organization
start looking at cubes about what they are interested in
financial institution around christmas time they decorated their workstation
a lady was offer to the side with Elvis things EVERYWHERE
looked at naming convention it was firstname.lastname and my list of passwords for her is going to be:
 "Thank you very much" (elvis quote)
 Elvis is the king
 long live elvis 
 elvis presley
 grace land
Create a list of passwords , THIS WORKED!!!^^^^
highest-lowest organize them 
key in each password and repeat it
3 attempts , and the above was over and he was in!

Password Cracking Algorithm
1. Find a valid user
2. Find encryption algorithm used - usually 1-way hashing with SALTING on it
3. Obtain encrypted passwords - particular server - i have this information, i don't need that database *breathes heavily* YOU WANNA MAINTAIN ACCESS AFTER THE FACT?
	you want that password list , they may lock you out of this one , but you have all of those
	company = OH WE'VE been hacked everyone needs to change their passwords - they're not going to change them that significantly - use the password database to come back in
	come back and get more user names and passwords - been seen > 2 times = adversarial - Remediation - radical passwords or 2-factor authentication 
 1. Need the SAM database - available on windows local machines , pull it - use it and go into the database ,  , get a match? you're in , create more than 1 account to maintain access
4. Create list of possible passwords
5. Encrypt each word - encrypt with the same algorithm and do comparison
6. See if there is a match for each user ID

Deans Password Attacking - not cracking
1. Identify the user name creation policy
 - EXAMPLE = first.last
2. Look for a new employee - hey how do you tell? we wouldve done reconn and saw job was posted on monster/linkedin we look at if it was taken down or people that apply
 - they change passwords to their favorite
 - are they a big fan of this football team or that basketball team or they like barbies or whatever it is
3. Search TormentedX networking sites - collect their favorite colors and what not , create a database for them
4. Build dictionary to match - complexity rules are easy on the first couple times , they expect you to screw up

NEW VECTOR
Call vector , Call support , use the employees name , im locked out please help me ,
heres your reset password = superbluepassword2 , please log in and change it now

Use this or Deans Password attacking 

Password Types - leet speak = numbers for letters , end users normally use a post it note or something when the password complexity is HIGH 
	-Flip the keyboard over , look around , it will be there!
	-Janatorial services will give you time
-only letters
-only numbers
-only special characters
-letters and numbers
-letters and special characters
-special characters and numbers
-all of the above 

Types of Password Attacks
-Dictionary attack
-Brute Force attack
-Hybrid attack
-TormentedX engineering - normal organization
-shoulder surfing - normal organization
-Dumpster diving - normal organization 

Cracking NT/2000 passwords
-SAM file contains the usernames and encrypted (hashed) passwords
 -LOCATED at %systemroot%\system32\config
-File is locked when the OS is running    
-Run rdisk to get an extra copy - a good admin will back up the file so that they do not lose the accounts
  - copy a copy locally and then copy to usb / disk
-Boot to an alternate OS
-Extract the hashes from the SAM file 

history is repeated even for the new operating systems

Redirecting SMB logon to the Attacker
-Trick the victim into attempting authentication to the attacker
-Send an email message tot he victim with an embedded hyperlink to an attackers SMB listener
-Clicking link is trusted
-Users login is cached
-User sends credentials - impersonate

SMB redirect Countermeasures
-Configure 2k to use SMB signing
 -Security Policies/Security Options
-Communication will be cryptographically signed at the block level of SMB

being washed out , still around though! they have software of some kind that ONLY works on windows 2000
Medical and Legal professionals! Custom applications that are only on windows 2000

NetBIOS DoS Attack
-Sending a 'NetBIOS Name Release'
-UDP 137 - name release , if i can get rid of your name and impersonate you
-Place its name in conflict
-this will block the client use of name

If i cant take your credentials , then i can block your ability authenticate

Land manager hashes , lanman hashes
people forget that these things were created and repeat mistakes

What is LanManager hash?
LM algorithm
-Converted to uppercase
-Pad with null characters to make it multiple of 7 character length
-Split in 7 character chunks
-Encrypt each string
     (hash)
-Concatenate the strings

LaNMan Countermeasures
-7-14 character apha-numeric passwords
-Password change policy every 30 days
-Physically isolate and protect the server
-Use SYSKEY to store hashes on disk
-Monitor logs for brute forcing

Keystroke Loggers - Favorite is Hardware
-Stealth software or hardware
-Between keyboard hardware and operating system
-Record every key stroke

you can intercept wireless keyboards
lets pretend its wired - most enterprises today use these
the keyboard has been used aggressively and has been eaten near or on, this is called Keyboard Plaque
turn it over and tap it , all the things fall out GROSS
go in as the cleaning crew for keyboards , bring in bright new shiny keyboards , we'll take yours and dishwash it because keyboards are dishwasher safe LOL
say "log off your system" LOOK AWAY , ok now lets plug this keyboard in and log back in , don't key in your password in front of me, let me turn my back
there are keyboards today that are set up with keystroke loggers, both wired and wireless.
after cleaning their keyboard and bringing it back you retrieve the keyboard which has the keystroke logger , this keyboard must have a similar asset tag it was temporary

What are the first key strokes that they used when you put the keyboard in ? USERNAME and Password
WOOHOO you WIN

Covering Tracks
-What Attackers do
-What pen testers rarely do - if its red team blue team they do but normally not
-Why?
 - Continue to control asset
 - Maintain control
 - Gather more data for larger attack 
 
Disabling Auditing - CANT DO IT ON A WINDOWS SYSTEM
-First thing intruders will do
-Turn it off
-Push evidence out of log

Log Wrapping - over writing - these are the systems you want
benign requests that push down information , using a lot of events , until its out of the system , lots of random stuff , but original attack is gone 

Clearing the event log
-Event Viewer
 - Remove all
 - Record removal as first event of next log
-Cannot remove single event 

Corrupt and Reset so that the attack is removed , just shows reset
looks like someone cleared off the machine 

we can clear the activity, how do we hide files locally on the system?
change attributes of the file or directory 

Hiding Files
-Attrib command
 - attrib +h [file/directory]
-NTFS Alternate Data Streaming
 - Think of extended properties of file - so that it can't be read by the interface 
 - Not limited in size
 - Can be more than one
 
Copying files with improper properties and protecting yourself and the asset you've captured

Creating Alternate Data Streams
-At command line
 - notepad test.txt
-Put data in the file
 - save the file
 - close notepad
-dir test.txt and note the file size
-notepad test.txt:hidden.txt
 - Type some text into notepad, save the file, and close
 - Check the file size again
-Open test.txt
 - you see your original data
hiding it from users eyes
if you have a file with users and passwords , you can leave it instead of bring it with you

Alternate Streams countermeasures - not much the good guys can do , good tool!
-Deleting a stream file
-Copy the 'front' file to a different file system
 - FAT to NTFS
 
What is steganography? can be done with data at rest or data in motion , inperceptable ,
-Process of hiding communication
-Graphic inside graphics
-Carrier must be larger than carried
-NOT encryption - you'd need encryption to go along with it
-Attackers embed information:
 - Source code for hacking tool
 - List of compromised servers
 - Plans for future attacks
 
 allows us to store information and come back for it later

Steganography Detection
-Many tools can analyze
-No one takes the time
-That is why it is so helpful at covering tracks

use sniffing or keystroke logging before password cracking 

Summary
-Password guessing/cracking
-Password sniffing is preferred
-Vulnerability scanning aids hacker by identifying which password cracking technique to use
-Keystroke logging
-Evidence of attack is eliminated by attackers
-Stealing files and hiding files are means used to sneak out sensitive information
