CEH NOTES
Module 1: Intro To the Course
how do you be an ethical hacker?
Objective:
Definitions and Terminology
Phases
-Attacking
-Ethical Hacking
-Professional penetration testing
Legal Implications

Why are we doing this?
when something is built, we just want to get it to work.
when we invented the wheel, we just wanted it to roll
we just want systems to work.

Why Security?
Evolution of technology focused availability
-not confidentiality or integrity
Increasing complexity of computer infrastructure administration and management
direct impact of security breach on corporate asset base and reputation
increasingly connected world

Essential Terminology
Threat - An action or event that might reduce security - confidentiality integrity accessability
Threat Agent - A person who takes inappropriate action - they use the threat - on vulnerability
Vulnerability - A weakness, design flaw, or implementation error - maybe lazy administrator
Attack - Assault on System - going after vulnerability
Exploit - A defined way to take advantage of a vulnerability


Can hacking be ethical?
hacker - a person who enjoys learning the details of computer systems and stretch their capabilities - person - likes to figure out how stuff works
hacking - rapid developments of new programs or the reverse engineering of already existing software - thing - breaking something apart
cracker - refers to an attacker who uses hacking skills against organizations causing harm - password breaking - ec council - against organizations - attacker = cracker
ethical hacker - security professional who uses hacking skills for organizations to increase security - good - follow proper process

Penetration testing
do what the attacker does before they do it to know the problem - fix it before it happens
Repel - put up new controls , put asset behind controls

What skills do you need?
good at computers

Skill profile:
Computer expert adept at technical - short cuts - specialist in some way shape or form - linux / aix / ios-mac / Windows - NOT 1 Person for all
in-depth knowledge about platforms
Networking
Hardware / software
Keeps with Current - INFOSEC NEWS - REDDIT - NEWS AGGREGATION TOOLS TO KEEP YOU INTO TOOLS AND SECURITY "I've read this and leads to 8-9 of study"

I understand this but have you heard of this? love/hate now i've got 8 hrs worth of homework
prepare for the homework!

Modes of Ethical Hacking
Black-box - no prior knowledge - person - NO CLUE - what attackers do
White-box - complete knowledge - everything - trusted insider, what could we do? 
Gray-box - access by insiders within the network - intranet access
start with black box and with reconassince it becomes a whitebox

Hacker Classes
Black hats - bad - self proclaimed evil
white hats - good
gray hats - ummm? - nobody knows
ethical hacker types
-Former black hats - probably
-White hats - could be
-Consulting firms - work with

Hacktivism
Refers to 'hacking with / for a cause' - i want freedom! justice! liberty! really means Love of Money!
a TormentedX or political agenda - more and more these days - the person i am afraid of is the person for the cause - do not get tired easily
Aims at sending a message - hey i want this access even if i go to jail, i don't care - hacktivism
gaining unauthorized access is a crime

What does a malicious hacker do?
Reconnaissance
Scanning
Gaining Access
Maintaining Access
Covering Tracks
Sell or use the assets

What does a penetration tester do?
he who writes the contract wins!
they do all of the things an attacker does, they've already been paid, do not sell the assets and report

What does an Ethical Hacker Do?
dont talk about the contract much or the report
do the same as pen testers

Penetration testing business
Contract 
Scope / Plan - contract and scope go hand in hand, what do you want tested? create a plan? this is costing this much, this is how long it will take
Reconnaissance / Scanning - figure it out
Do = Attack
-Gaining Access
-Maintain Access
-Covering Tracks
REPORT = business action items - we found these things , fix them this way! what business is all about!

Professional Testing Process
job is to fly down crap all over it , give a good report , REMEDIATE NOT INCLUDED
Do = CEH only ECCOUNCIL - contract ONLY

What is the goal?
Who, What, Where, When, How 
What is the value of the asset? - Ask what are you protecting , what is it worth? if its 1m i don't want to do 1m test
Who is commissioning the test? Technical or Business?
Who is going to read report? - Technical person write report 1 way , Business person another way of report
What is the budget for remediation? 10,000$ for 1m asset or calculated over time

Generic list of options to client
Make it easy - like a menu in a food restaurant - dont have time or money for ALL ON THE MENU - BIG LIST - EXPLAIN
cross off what they don't want tested - Stay away from DOS or TormentedX engineering
Circle what they do want tested - i want this i want that
Question mark on what they don't know - do you understand what that thing is, do we actually need that?
sign off on draft of plan - statement of work , scoping document , write formal plan 
Where do we get the menu from?

Open Source Security Testing = OSST version 3 - HARD CHOICES EASY LIFE - EASY CHOICES HARD LIFE - Mr. Scott 2017 <3

How Much Time?
Somone is getting paid by the day - gotta get paid , how much money do you have? range of days?
-Cannot test forever
Deadline for Compliance - may have a deadline - military - FISMA regulation Special publication 853 states something to the effect of pen test on annual basis - when is report? work around organization
Deadling for Reporting - may be that i need this report before the compliance, so that we can do something about it
Deadline for product release - when? work your way back , how long will it take to do the test? 5-10 days? how long for the fix? divide it up give time.
-minus time for testing
-minus time for fixing

what rookies forget about!!!
3rd parties - where are the servers sitting?
Colocation
Cloud provider
Partner - have a system?
Vendor - this part of connectivity
What level of interaction is required?
what if we're not allowed to go this far? block all access! GET PERMISSION , BUILD IN SCOPE
MAKE SURE THIS IS IN WRITING
Prepare with forensic approach - not an ECCOUNCIL thing , when building a lab , create a virtual image
Clean virtual machines for whole team
New Database - can take the data that is being collected in 1 place , self contained
Virtual network that records all activity - listener
Possible client recording - client should also record all activity through their network , we are prepared to collect without corrupting

How do you collect Data?
Physical - locations you have been to bring to client as proof , can collect from SCOPE
-GPS tracking & photographs
ORGANIC or INORGANIC
Virtual
-Packet Captures & Screen Shots
ORGANIC or INORGANIC

Penetration testing methodology
Discovery - hey theres a website out there with our name on it , what is their IP
- CEH - Reconnaissance
- Find your target
Enumeration - what ports are open?
- CEH - Scanning
- list their software and versions
Vulnerability Mapping -
- CEH - ? - no name - assume tool will get them there
- Find exploit to match the weakness - version X has a buffer overflow vulnerability , map vulnerability , dont stick your finger in the wound
Exploitation - does this hurt?
- CEH - Gain & maintain controls - running software , coughing up shell
- Run exploit software against target

Reconnaissance types
-Zero contact - CEH = footprinting , search engines , history website data , directories , people , locational data, dns , isp / ip assignments , hosting services
google has gps and wireless data , we can find this and be able to know where a certain IP is exactly , talk to the people = not saying hi! , its what do you know about them? to someone else collect that information
-Low contact - competitive intelligence , partners , vendors , customers
have to ask if it is ok to talk to these people, not ok to talk to customers but vendors ect is OK , this is low because , INDIRECT
-High Contact - Scanning = IP address, ports, services Fuzzing = from website , input to public database , random , non-random
scanning = Find out open ports , IP addresses , what services?
fuzzing = jam data in and see what happens
non random data = input value data or testing
-Vulnerability research
do you know any weaknesses?
look to databases = OSVDB.org - Collected a lot of this information - OPEN SOURCE
we collect this information - the client may stop you at this point

Transition
Scope -> Plan Reconn Data -> DO ATTACK - Report

Do - Attack
Apply Exploit - Capture flag or file - identify the password hash - crack password - crack encryption
couple of different ways , because of config , give me directory , in-scope , progression
identify password hash - if we can find the hash value of a password and we can pull it back from system , matter of time before we can looking up hash in table
crack password - find something that WILL work in place of password
crack encryption - is there a tool to break this AES/DES ITS POSSIBLE!

Apply exploit - normal PENTEST , subscriptions to tool vendors

Free = metasploit
Build = reverse engineering , shell coding , learn how to break apart software
Buy = big rumor out there USGOV buys exploits!

This is what we love to do! this is the SCOPE!!

where do we get the tools?

3 vendors 
metasploit = OPEN
Canvas =  Immunity
Core Impact

These have general exploits to apply to system

Metasploit and all the tools
Dean Said
-You do not have permission
-You must ask in writing
-You must have printed, signed permission
-You Could go to jail!
If you don't
-Search Video metasploit tutorial

In some countries even having the tools is illegal
Be careful with military or government

why do we call it a pentest?
the reason we call it a pen test is because you have to put a pen to paper and ask for permission , printed signed!

Transition
Scope->Plan Reconn Data->Do->Report

Clearly state we've finished testing
20% of test is report , clearly communicate , effect change
reporting is not I GOT YOU!!!
Raw data - output of scan - data files from packet captures
A map to hack the organization - it should not be

going to a company - have you had a pen test before?
OH yeah! heres the raw data , report , i'll email it to you in plain text , the password is password!
PROTECT YOUR DATA! Do not leave this on the server

Reporting Success
Repeatability - here it is - i've done mine , heres my report , its like an experiment
-Apply same methodology - get the same results
-Apply same methodology after fixes - get different results - control in place
Actionable - i know what i need to do next
Business understandable - i get it we got a problem with authentication

Example
When testing 
We found # of weaknesses in this category
-Could be ZERO - they've plugged up the holes
We prove that a failure happened
-@ date & time
-See packets n-m nmap - not heres this list , this file is encrypted , we have this as proof
Business strategies for fixing this are... is this , these things
More research can be found at... general test

What constitutes proof?
Screenshots are not proof 
-they are not actionable - what do we do about this?
-they do get managements attnetion
Packet captures are proof - not understandable by business
but they are also a map to hack
MUST BE BALANCED IN REPORT FOR TECHNICAL / BUSINESS

Roll it up! CEH style READ PENTESTMAG.COM
Summary of Phases CEH style
1. Reconnaissance
- Prepatory phase
- Gather as much information as possible
2. Scanning - pick @ system
- Dialers
- Port Scanners
- Network Mapping
- Ping Sweeping
- Vulnerability Scanners
3. Gaining Access - a lot of chances there is no initial level of access
- Exploits system
- Any Layer
- Influencing factors
  - Architecture and configuration of target
  - Skill level of the perpetrator
  - Initial level of access obtained 
4. Maintaining Access - dont do it the normal way , put things underneath , migrate from process to process for higher level of privelage
- Attacker tries to retain 'ownership' of system
- Will tamper and compromise system
 - New Accounts
 - Extra Software
 - Back Doors
- Harden System
 - Patch it for victim - nobody else gets in
- Owned , rooted , got root - POWNED , OWNING
5. Covering Tracks - getting paid to sneak around , clear logs 
- Extend misuse of system without being detected
- Remove evidence of hacking , avoiding legal action
- Steganography , tunneling , altering log files - sneak around yet keep control and alert intrusion detection system
- Start a fresh reconnaissance to another target system

Deliverables = Report
- Detailed results of testing activity produced
- Matched against the scope of work - if we did something wrong , don't include it in report
- Vulnerabilities are detailed 
- Corrective measures are suggested

Round out module : Computer Crimes and Implications
- Cyber Security Act 2002
 - Life sentences for hackers who 'recklessly' endanger the lives of others
- Computer Crime and Security Survey - anyone who is a customer , must be notified STATE LAW
 - 90% of respondents acknowledged security breaches
 - 34% reported the crime
 - Stigma associated with reporting lapses
- FBI computer crimes squad estimates - Businesses have already been ATTACKED!
 - 85 to 97% of intrusions are not detected
Lets try and figure out what this person has done and clean your systems!

Legal Perspectives (US FEDERAL LAW)
- 18 USC * 1029 - biggie
 - Fraud and refuted activity in connection with access devices
- * 1030 - biggie
 - Fraud and related activity in connection with computers
- * 1362 - wires and switches
 - communication lines, stations , or systems
- * 2510 - wire tapping 
 - wired electronic commiunications interception and interception of oral communications
- * 2701
 - Stored Wire and electronic communications transactionnel records access

Summary
- Ethical hacking is a methodology to simulate a malicious attack without causing damage
- hacking involves 5 phases
- US statutes 1029 and 1030 primarily address cyber crime
