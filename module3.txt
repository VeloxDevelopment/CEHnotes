Module 3: Scanning Networks

In footprinting we talked about scanning
we talked about finding an ip address range
Range ---- web server here
what else is out there?
what is the destination?
once we figure out where the hosts are, we ask the company if its in scope
what type of host?

Detail - Where are we?
still in reconn

Module Objectives :
-Detect live systems
-discover services running / listening
-understanding port scanning
-identifying tcp and udp services
-Discovering the operating system 
-Active and passive fingerprinting 

Detecting 'Live' WIRED systems? - where they are , why they are
- Detecting 'Live' WIRED systems on a network target, Why?
- Determine the perimeter of the network - where are the firewall resources?
- Facilitate network mapping - this is what we can see from the outside , this is what we see from the inside
- Inventory accessible systems on target network - catalog all information gathered

Recon: Port Scanning
-Scanning = Reconnaissance
-Most popular reconn technique
-Can be client or server - still services - SQL slammer attack , administrator port was open on servers VISIO = underlying database , remotely manage sql on client, succeptable to attack
-Target computer runs many 'services' 
 - listen at 'well known' 'ports' 
-Which ports are available on the target - whats the software running behind that? what version? what vulnerabilities? how will we attack
 - Potential Vulnerabilities

Levels of Scanning
-Host
 - Modem = Telephone Number - still to this day exist , scan if its in the scope! Dial the number or use HackersChoice , what service? 
  - how do you find the group of phone numbers? you take from the footprinting , shows phone number and fax number on business website! look there , may look at DNS from whois , phone numbers there RANGES
  - identify and do not go any deeper, are these yours? <- to business , Get Approval!
  - Recon: Tel: War Dialers
   - Tool used to scan a large pool of telephone numbers
   - detects vulnerable modems
   - Provides access to the system - may!
  - Recon: Tel: Demon Dialer
   - Tool used to monitor a specific phone number
   - Target its modem to gain access - picking to find out this information
 - Network card = IP address = ICMP - Use Ping or pingsweep tool
-Service = UDP/TCP Port - are you talking? is there an open port?
-Version = Unique pattern of response - ok you're a web server , what version of the OS are you running? what software are you running? Vulnerability Mapping , stop here , Poking!


We did the phones ^ now lets do the network! the IP / TCP
Recon: IP: PING
- Is the computer on? - im an active machine , we know about this , what about above and below , is it Class A , B , C , Class A = 16million IP addresses you dont want to do this , narrow your scope
- ICMP Echo Request Packet?
- ICMP Echo Reply Message from an active machine!
- Why not a whole range of IP addresses?
 - Ping Sweep
- ICMP reply can be more than just YES

Why is it called ping? submarines ping and echo - ECHO location
Mike Moose wrote original program of PING 

Recon: IP: ICMP type/code
http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters
Nice long list! KNOW IT

PING sweeps are noisy! - 1 at a time , do different sweeps! Windows XP service pack 1/2 these hosts will not respond anymore , could be a filter!
Recon: IP: Detecting Ping Sweeps
- Ping sweeps form a basic step in network mapping
- Polling IP address ranges
- They are noisy from a IDS's view
- Don't have an IDS?
 - Firewalls do just fine
 
 ICMP says im here! we want to get to underlying service to attack! and find the vulnerability
 
 Recon: TCP three-way handshake
Client Host = connection request (SYN = 1, seq=client_isn) --> Server Host = connection granted (SYN=1 seq=server_isn, ack = client_isn+1) --> client host(2) = ack (SYN=0, seq=cleint_isn+1, ack = server_isn+1) --> server host
ALL is measured in time going down , the client has LESS time than server
inbetween these exchanges are vulnerabilities

Client = i would like to talk to you , sends SYN , ON = 1 
Server = this is bidimensional communication , ACK SYN message
Send both ACK SYN to get ACK = ACK FIN
PORT IS OPEN!

There is other information we can get from server
Sequences start at certain numbers , certain servers say my TTL is 35 - 114 - 32
Learning about the host

We can do a variety of scans
-Open = SYN scan - We'll send SYN to ports IF response = open
-Half- Open - says ok im only going to send a portion of a packet
-Xmas - all lights on light a christmas tree , all Flags , besides RST = reset , certain hosts respond certain ways
-Stealth(idle) - bring in another host , what are your updates? are you transferring a lot or are you slow?
-Decoy - really interesting , i want to test you but i don't want you to know im testing you , mask IP , IP is unauthenticated , pretend to be someone else
 - send information to you!
 - attacking
 - Look up good IP addresses to use
 - Bad people use D-Shield lists to find IPS
 - Use these

Recon: UDP/TCP
-No connection - no three way handshake
-Send UDP with no data = host drop
-Response
 - ICMP error = closed (port unreachable)
 - Nothing = open or filtered = firewall
 - Nothing is good recon - there is a firewall there!
 
How are you going to scan a network?
ping sweep , port sweep , ping scan , port scan

Tool: NMap (Network Mapper)
-Can find OS aswell
-2 different types , Command line version = YOU NEED TO KNOW , before this think Zenmap = Graphical Version
-It shows you the command you are choosing based on config
-Host details and other details that are important to use or Report
-Look at output and you WIN 
-Custom scan and name it under a profile and you WIN
-Sort it by host or service , or OS
-Excellent tool
Exam stand point
-Gotta know all switches and what ports mean
-what a -S is and a -PA
-Spend 1-4 hours with NMAP
-need to know combinations
-know combinations other people have created! - elegant scans and profiles people have created
-NMAP.org - Learn what the community is doing - moving forward on a regular basis
- Input - Output Output - Input Configs/Profiles
-NESSUS - Vulnerability scanning
- Output of NMAP is good to show people what we've done and switches used
- Output with a variety of formats
- Use XML , and place in Excel
- Little pieces and put them in seperate files
- Linux has easy way of doing this
- Divide it by hosts
 - we're looking at 60 wordpress servers on UNIX - this person gets those hosts
 - Active Directory Servers - This goes to there
DATA IN NICE NEAT CHUNKS - DONT TAKE ONE HUGE LIST it'll take forever and won't be easy to show the client

Nmap command sampler - CASE COUNTS - HAVE TO KNOW CASE
-h Nmap help
-sS TCP SYN scan
-sT TCP connect() scan
-sU UDP port scans
-v Verbose output
-vv Very Verbose output
-O detect operating system (TCP/IP fingerprinting)
-sV Service version detection
-P0 don't ping, just scan
-A Agressive; as of right now this does the same thing as -O -sV
-T Paranoid|Sneaky|Polite|Normal|Aggressive|Insane
-p Choose your ports (scan all ports with 0-65535)
-F Fast Scan:Scans only ports in the nmap-services files
-n Don't do reverse DNS lookup

65,000 hosts , carve it into chunks , you're getting paid for hours or days

Active Stack Fingerprinting - what are the unique characterists of the system with the response given
- Determine the remote OS
- Attacker leaves smaller footprint
- OS vendors implement TCP stack differently
- Attacker sends crafted packets
- Target response
- Compared response with a database
- match = good guess
MAPPING - verify guesses

Passive fingerprinting
- Less accurate than active
- Packet captures
- Listening to network
- Victim has nothing to detect
- P0F2 - Passive Fingerprinting version 2
These two hosts are talking back and forth and this looks like this
we now have to rely on less accurate data
if we're inside as the fake adversarie , it doesn know that we're there! thats why we would use passive

So you think you know Kung Fu?
- Most of these fingerprinting tools talk
- You want to hear them
- You set up firewall and intrusion detection
- You think you know
 - where attacker is coming from?
They are listening! they know where you are coming from! this is a battle, not trundling along
come from different locations
don't use a coffee shop , illegal and bad

Triple over-build
3 different IPS 3 Different ISPs to be used at any time - that may not be good enough!
work with other pentesters , i'd like to use your IP , can i terminal into a machine on your side
don't compromise a host here and there to cover tracks
do this in a white hat way , legal way
do this so you know Kung Fu

Defense
-Could victim not answer?
 - Block (firewall)
-Could victim answer many ways?
 - .htm .asp .php .txt (fuzzing)
- if you get 1 response php and another asp , what kind of host is this?
- Fuzz the return to mess with you
- Mangle = Linux = Twist packets in a certain order so they can't figure out who you are
- Confirm everything , defenses could be fooling you

I told you to find some IPs so that the good guys don't know where you are coming from
this may not be good enough
use other tools
figure out things to hop through hosts

What is SOCKS v5?
-Firewall systems act as application layer-gateways
-Client / Server applications need to talk - allows us to bypass a firewall , inside or outside
-A framework for applications protocols to transparently and securely traverse a firewall
-Why?
 - Target doesnt know where attacker is
 
 lets say i have your laptop from company network , you leave for a coffee shop with the laptop sit down and i attack it and you take it back in
 SOCKS is a form of proxy , passes data , can install software or certain activites
 compromise host
 
SocksChain
-A program that allows to connect to any internet service through a chain of SOCKS or HTTP proxies to hide the actual IP address
if we break a link , there is no traceability back to the source

Proxy Servers
-A network computer that can serve as an intermediate for connection with other computers
-Good and bad guys can use them
 - as firewall - filter
 - as IP-addresses multiplexer - AKA NAT/PAT PAT = port address translation NAT = Network Address Translation
 - to anonymize web surfing - nobody knows
 - to filter unwanted content - no you can't go to inappropriate sites , do your work

 Anonymizers = Proxy server - protect privacy of person , 1000's out there
-Web surfing anonymizer
-First anonymizer developed was anonymizer.com, created in 1997 by Lance Cottrell, from COTSE
he is loosely with Cult of the Swimming Elephant

Bypassing Firewall using Httptunnel
-Just another proxy
-Layering games
abstraction - moving up and down OSI stack - wasn't designed for this

HTTPort
-proxy to get around a proxy
-HTTPort allows you to bypass an HTTP proxy, which is blocking you from the internet

If you've captured an asset inside a company and need to get back out but its blocking you , use this
